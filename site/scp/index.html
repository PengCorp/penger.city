            <strong>Mankind in its present form has been around for a quarter of a million
                years, yet only a small fraction of that has been spent with the
                knowledge of Penger.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll admit it - we love Penger. We love him so much that we've decided to dedicate our lives to
            documenting and appreciating him. We've been doing this for a while now, and we've gotten pretty good at it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've got a lot of Pengers in our database. We've got Pengers that can do all sorts of things. We've got Pengers
            that can make you laugh, and Pengers that can make you cry.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to share our love of Penger with the world. That's why we've created this website. Here you'll find
            information on all of the Pengers we've documented, as well as information on how to appreciate them better.
        </p>
        <p>
            So take a look around. We're sure you'll find something that you like. And who knows? Maybe you'll even learn
            something new about Penger.

        <h1>SCP-ENGER: &quot;Penger, <del>your mom&#39;s banger!</del> the Pixelated Penguin of
                Mischief&quot;</h1>
        <p class="attribution">
            By Iselgrey
        </p>
        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
        <p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-ENGER is to be contained on a standard computer terminal,
            desktop background, image file or application in a Foundation-controlled device. A dedicated website has been
            designed for containment and study of this funny creature. Access to SCP-ENGER used to be restricted to Level 2
            personnel and above but this restriction has been relaxed to allow contact with all personnel due to good
            behaviour exhibited by SCP-ENGER. All interactions with SCP-ENGER must be logged and reviewed for potential
            security breaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-ENGER is a pixelated image of a penguin, approximately 32x32 pixels in size,
            with a distinctive tuxedo-like pattern of black and white pixels and orange feet and beak. It is typically
            depicted in a neutral or mischievous pose.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether SCP-ENGER is a single entity or multiple entities with similar characteristics. Multiple
            versions of SCP-ENGER have been observed, each with slight variations in appearance or behavior. However, it is
            impossible to determine whether these versions are separate entities or simply different manifestations of the
            same creature.</p>
        <p>SCP-ENGER&#39;s behavior is typically docile and cooperative, often assisting programmers with coding tasks and
            cooking soup. However, SCP-ENGER has been observed to occasionally exhibit &quot;naughty&quot; behavior,
            including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Appearing in unexpected locations or contexts</li>
            <li>Liking your mom very much</li>
            <li>Spilling soup</li>
            <li>Introducing itself as a &quot;mascot&quot; or &quot;icon&quot; in various programming projects or
                initiatives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contexts in which SCP-ENGER has been observed include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forum posts and comments</li>
            <li>Wallpapers and desktop backgrounds</li>
            <li>Streaming sessions and videos of seasoned recreational programmers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is unclear what the full extent of SCP-ENGER&#39;s capabilities are, but it is clear that it is a highly
            adaptable and resilient entity.</p>
        <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Following further research, it has been determined that SCP-ENGER possesses at least one
            distinct alter ego, hearby designated SCP-ONGER. SCP-ONGER is to be considered a separate entinty for the
            purposes of containment and research.</p>
        <p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Following <strong>Incident ENGER-B</strong>, it has been suggested that the level of
            security surrounding SCP-ENGER be reduced. Dr. █████ is interested in measuring SCP-ENGER&#39;s ability to
            spread through social media networks.</p>
        <p><strong>Incident Report ENGER-A:</strong> On ██-██-████, SCP-ENGER was observed to have spontanously manifested
            on the desktop of a Level 4 researcher, replacing the standard wallpaper with a modified version featuring
            itself at a stylistically appealing location. The incident was resolved, and increased security measures were
            implemented to prevent future occurrences.</p>
        <p><strong>Incident Report ENGER-B:</strong> On ██-██-████, a second event involving SCP-ENGER occurred, wherein
            SCP-ENGER manifested on the desktop of the same Level 4 researcher, this time in a different wallpaper image.
            This incident demonstrated the ineffectiveness of previously established security measures. Following review, it
            was determined that SCP-ENGER incidents of this nature can be safely disregarded without adverse consequences.
