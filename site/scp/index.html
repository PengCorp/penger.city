        <strong>Mankind in its present form has been around for a quarter of a million
            years, yet only a small fraction of that has been spent with the
            knowledge of Penger.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We'll admit it - we love Penger. We love him so much that we've decided to dedicate our lives to
        documenting and appreciating him. We've been doing this for a while now, and we've gotten pretty good at it.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've got a lot of Pengers in our database. We've got Pengers that can do all sorts of things. We've got Pengers
        that can make you laugh, and Pengers that can make you cry.
    </p>
    <p>
        We want to share our love of Penger with the world. That's why we've created this website. Here you'll find
        information on all of the Pengers we've documented, as well as information on how to appreciate them better.
    </p>
    <p>
        So take a look around. We're sure you'll find something that you like. And who knows? Maybe you'll even learn
        something new about Penger.
