Download .umd.min.js bundle from cdnjs and rename it to just module.js, plop it here.
Then you can load it with require.

If it's just a simple js bundle you can just add it but it will not be loadable with require.js.

Version numbers are listed below because the filenames must match the module names.

"preact": "10.24.3",
